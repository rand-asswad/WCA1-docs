The generalization follows the outline of Chapters 6 and 7. We first determine suitable window classes for the short-time Fourier transform on the modulation spaces and investigate their properties. Section 2 then explores the mapping properties of the analysis and synthesis operators. Then the boundedness of the Gabor frame operator on the modulation spaces proves sufficient to characterize modulation spaces via tight Gabor frames or Wilson bases. Section 4 treats a problem in data compression by means of non-linear approximation with Wilson bases.},

The procedure is significantly more efficient computationally than the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) for transforming functions or measured responses which decay slowly with increasing abscissa value. We illustrate the proposed method with an example from electromagnetic geophysics, where the scaling is often such that our logarithmic Fourier transform (LFT) should be applied. For the example chosen, we are able to obtain results that agree with those from an FFT to within 0.5 per cent in a time that is a factor of 10’ shorter. Potential applications of our LFT in geophysics include conversion of wide-band electromagnetic frequency responses to transient responses, glacial loading and unloading, aquifer recharge problems, normal mode and earth tide studies in seismology, and impulsive shock wave modelling.},

The mathematical formulation relies on a cortical-inspired modelling [10] largely used over the last years to describe neuron interactions in the primary visual cortex (V1) and applied to several image processing problems [12,19,13]. Our model connects to Wilson-Cowan-type equations [23] and it is analogous to the one used in [3,2,14] to describe assimilation and contrast phenomena, the main novelty being its explicit dependence on local image orientation. To confirm the validity of the model, we report some numerical tests showing its ability to explain orientation-dependent phenomena (such as grating induction) and geometric-optical illusions [21,16] classically explained only by filtering-based techniques [6,18].},

	isbn = {978-1-4577-2191-5},
	abstract = {In physics, mathematics, and several related disciplines like spectroscopy, the Cauchy probability distribution plays an important role. Therefore, a parameter estimation methodology for data which is distributed according to a Cauchy distribution is of great practical importance. However, the Cauchy distribution is also well known for causing difficulties with standard approaches. It has undefined moments due its heavy tails, effectively modeling a high probability that large outlying events occur, making parameter estimation an exceptionally difficult task. In this paper, we explore possibilities to accurately estimate unknown parameters from data distributed according to a Cauchy distribution for an arbitrary linear model by showing a computationally simple way to iteratively solve the complicated associated likelihood equations. We furthermore state insightful interpretations of the resulting estimators and parameter estimation bounds, revealing a basic structure for robust parameter estimation procedures derived for completely different probability distributions.},

This paper considers a class of omnibus procedures for testing the hypothesis that the unknown distribution of X belongs to the family of Cauchy laws. The test statistics are weighted integrals of the squared modulus of the difference between the empirical characteristic function of the suitably standardized data and the characteristic function of the standard Cauchy distribution. A large-scale simulation study shows that the new tests compare favorably with the classical goodness-of-fit tests for the Cauchy distribution, based on the empirical distribution function. For small sample sizes and short-tailed alternatives, the uniformly most powerful invariant test of Cauchy versus normal beats all other tests under discussion.},

It is shown that the situation is essentially the same for hyperbolic symmetries: the signals are eigenvectors of the Schrodinger operator associated to the hyperbolic oscillator. Since this operator has continuous spectrum, these symmetries can only be reached approximately. It is also shown how to construct such signals and their ambiguity functions, which fall in two classes, are given. This work is essentially abstract nilpotent harmonic analysis, and is based on the well-known main fact that the Woodward ambiguity function is a positive-type function on the real Heisenberg Lie group.{\textless}{\textgreater}},
