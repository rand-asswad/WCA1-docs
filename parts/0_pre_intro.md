I am also extremely grateful to Natalie Fortier for her support during my studies
in the GM department, especially during the last two years.
My thanks extend to the GM professors who have helped me discover my passion
and opened my mind to new horizons.
I would also like to thank the professors of the ITA Master's program
at University of Rouen Normandie, especially Jean-Philippe Dubernard.

Most importantly, I thank my family, without their tremendous support
it would be impossible for me to complete my studies.

for their unwaivoring support throughout my education,
Jad and Mery for their care and support despite the distance.

Finally, I want to thank my second Rouen family, Ibrahim
